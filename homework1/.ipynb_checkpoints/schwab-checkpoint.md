# Fintech Case Study Robo Investing (Schwab)

##Overview and Origin
Schwab Inc. is eponymously named for its founder Charles R. Schwab, a graduate of Stanford University College and Business School.  The origins of the company was actually as an Investment Newsletter in 1963 transitioning to brokerage in 1971. The big break for Schwab came in 1975 when the Securities and Exchange Commission deregulated the securities industry. The deregulation allowed brokerage firms to charge any fees they wanted. Schab immediately cut their fees in half. Schwab switched the way it paid its salesforce, putting them solely on salary, thus removing conflicts of interest of sales people which previously had incentives to maximize commissions to the detriment of their clients.
From its earliest days, Schwab focused on both cutting cost and expanding customer service through automation. Schwab invests BETA mainframe system, which demonstrate the key role of technology in company growth. In 1980 Schwab started the first 24-hour quotation service. !989 Schwab introduces TeleBroker, an automated telephone brokerage service. By 1995 the company was the largest discount brokerage firm, with revenues of $1.4 billion and $200 billion in total assets managed. Initially Schwab used technologic computerization to reduce and replace paperwork. In 1995 Schwab launches Schwab.com.  In 1996 Schwab became the first major financial services firm to sell online.
In 2015 Schwab launches Schwab Intelligent Portfolios, which their “robo advising” product. Schwab Intelligent Portfolio is available directly to online customer, and is available to independent  financial advisors.

## Business Activity

Schwab and all “Robo Advisors” are essentially solving three problems. 
1.	Easy access to investment management. With internet access to the internet you are literally one click away from having a well diversified model portfolio.
2.	Use of well thought out model portfolios, replace financial advisors that are more proficient at selling financial products and services than providing competent investment advice.
3.	Rebalancing of portfolios are handled automatically by computers, eliminating reliance on possibly unreliable human advisors.
The market size is large and growing rapidly. The market size was 47.3 Billion  AUM (Asset under Management) in 2015. Grew to $98 Billion AUM in 2016 and projected to grow to $460 Billion AUM by 2022.
Schwab uses a 12 point questionnaire that feeds into their computer algorithm. The questionnaire takes into account the customer’s current financial situation,  goals and timeframe plus risk tolerance. The computer algorithm then combines all this information to offer a choice of model portfolios. Schwab uses 83 different model portfolios, based on the information entered by the client. The computer algorithm then uses a Monte Carlo simulation to project probable future outcome for the portfolio.
The computer algorithm monitors the model portfolios and rebalances the portfolio

## Landscape
Robo Advising is the newest trend in the Wealth Management sector. As noted above this trend is rapidly growing While there are barriers to entry due to capital investment requirements, in addition to legal hurdles, the barriers seem small in relation to potential profits. As one would expect given opportunity for high profit margins, there are many players in  this segment.
It is easiest to divide the sector into those that are new pure play companies, and those that are older established companies. Older established companies include Mutual Fund companies like Vanguard, Fidelity, and of course Schwab which has their own funds. Citibank and Bank of America through Merrill Edge Guided Investment. Two leaders in the pure play segment are Betterment and Wealthfront.
Results
As noted previously, the growth of robo advising has spectacular. Starting from zero roughly 10 years ago to almost half a Trillion in AUM! Assets under management is THE metric that counts, since variable costs are almost zero.

## Recommendations
While It might seem investment performance would be the key driver for success in this sector, I have a different take. As long as each robo advisor stays away from high fee mutual funds, the performance should be similar among competitors. This could be a problem for legacy established investment companies, where internal politics may require use of internal high cost funds. This gives a clear advantage for new upstarts like Betterment, which start with a clean slate. Marketing is key. This where old familiar firms like Schwab have a clear advantage. Schwab has been running television and print advertisements for decades. Is there anyone that hasn’t heard of Schwab? Besides focusing on marketing, I would recommend simplifying the internet portals.
